# Facial Recognition in Real-Time Frame

## Overview
This project is a real-time facial recognition system that detects and recognizes faces using **OpenCV** and **deep learning** techniques. It can be used for security applications, attendance systems, and user authentication.

## Features
- **Real-time Face Detection and Recognition** – Uses deep learning-based face encoding and matching.
- **High Accuracy** – Optimized performance with efficient algorithms.
- **Easy Integration** – Works with cameras and video streams.
- **User-Friendly** – Simple interface for training and recognition.

## Technologies Used
- **Python, OpenCV** – Image processing and real-time recognition.
- **Dlib, Face-Recognition Library** – Face encoding and feature extraction.
- **NumPy** – Efficient numerical operations.

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GOBINDABISTA/Facial-Recognization-In-Real-TimeFrame.git
cd Facial-Recognization-In-Real-TimeFrame

# Install dependencies
pip install opencv-python numpy dlib face-recognition
```

## Usage
```bash
# Run the facial recognition system
python face_recognition.py
```
- The system will detect faces and recognize known individuals in real-time.
- Press `q` to exit the application.

## Dataset
- The system can use pre-trained models or custom datasets for training.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement **Deep Learning Models** for improved recognition.
- Integrate **GPU Acceleration** for faster performance.
